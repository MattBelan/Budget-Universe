Hi there.

There may be an issue where the project does not build when you attemp to run it.
If this happens, please try the following:

Make sure you are building to x86
-It didn't want to work on x64, and we couldn't find a solution to that

Try Changing the Windows SDK Version
-This can be changed by going to Project->Properties->Configuration Properties under General
-We don't know why this is an issue, but changing it will most likely solve any issues that arrise

Thanks for understanding
